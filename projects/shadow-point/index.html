 <h1>🎮 Shadow Point - Accessibility & VR Comfort Testing Case Study (Quest 3) - Tested: 08/12/2025 - 13/12/2025</h1>

<!-- Intro -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  One-week, solo, self directed QA portfolio project on <em>Shadow Point</em> (Meta Quest 3, standalone), tested from
  8 to 13 December 2025. The project focused on accessibility, comfort, and seated VR play, with particular attention to
  early-game onboarding, locomotion, camera behaviour, text readability, audio cues, and cognitive load during puzzle interaction.
</p>
<p>
  Testing was exploratory and charter driven, using structured comfort, accessibility, and cognitive heuristics rather than
  full functional or content coverage. The scope did not aim to replicate studio QA or full regression, but to evaluate access
  and comfort risks that could affect usability, retention, and first-time VR experience.
</p>
<p>
  Charters and checks were informed by established XR accessibility guidance and applied insight from industry practitioners,
  including Ian Hamilton’s VR comfort principles, BBC XR cognitive barriers, W3C XR Accessibility User Requirements, Game
  Accessibility Guidelines, and practitioner feedback from Dr Tracy Gardner on cybersickness and movement risk. These
  frameworks were used to shape charter design, session focus, and how findings were framed and prioritised.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Scope:</strong> Solo, self directed one-week portfolio pass on <em>Shadow Point</em> using Meta Quest standalone
    (build 1.4). Coverage focused on VR accessibility, comfort, and seated usability in the early rooms, including subtitles,
    non-audio cue redundancy, input flexibility, comprehension and expectation checks, and comfort stability during locomotion
    and the cable car sequence. No claim of studio coverage or full regression.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Approach:</strong> Risk-based charter testing executed through a Charter Matrix and time-boxed Session Log.
    Charters were marked complete or consolidated where coverage overlapped, with follow-up checks only when new risks surfaced
    (for example, subtitle behaviour triggering deeper subtitle-specific coverage). Applied Insight notes were used to shape
    charters and expectations for accessibility and comfort checks.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong> 20 logged sessions (S-001 to S-020) produced 11 tracked issues. Key themes included subtitle
    readability and occlusion (SP-12, SP-17, SP-24, SP-25), clarity and confirmation gaps when audio cues were removed
    (SP-27, SP-28), and Room 3 seated interaction and UI clarity issues (SP-18 to SP-21). One additional low priority visual
    issue was logged for hand alignment during move plus look (SP-4).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Evidence:</strong> Workbook tabs exported as PDF (Session Log, Charter Matrix, Bug Log) supported by video and
    screenshot evidence per session and per issue. Sessions include timestamp anchors for key observations, and Bug Log entries
    record the matching media type (video, screenshot, or both).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="star-summary">⭐ STAR SUMMARY – Shadow Point VR Accessibility and Comfort QA (Meta Quest 3)</h2>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong> One-week, solo, self directed QA portfolio project on <strong>Shadow Point</strong> on Meta Quest 3 standalone (build <strong>1.4</strong>), tested from <strong>8 to 13 December 2025</strong>. Testing focused on early game play in seated VR, where comfort, readability, and clarity issues can quickly become access barriers.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Run a realistic charter-driven accessibility and comfort pass for seated VR play. Prioritise high-risk areas including locomotion and turning comfort, horizon stability, camera predictability, subtitle legibility, non-audio cue redundancy (especially at volume 0), input flexibility and fatigue, and cognitive barriers during puzzle interaction (comprehension, expectation, and wayfinding).</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Created a charter set informed by applied XR accessibility guidance (comfort fundamentals, cognitive barriers, and XR accessibility requirements), then executed <strong>20</strong> time-boxed sessions (S-001 to S-020) with timestamp anchors and evidence capture. Coverage and decisions were tracked through a Charter Matrix, with outcomes summarised in a 1-Liner Summary for fast review. Issues were logged in a structured Bug Log with severity, reproducibility, and linked evidence, and high-impact themes were followed up in targeted rechecks (for example, subtitle behaviour driving deeper subtitle-specific coverage).</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Logged <strong>11</strong> issues in total (<strong>7 medium</strong>, <strong>4 low</strong>), with reproducibility recorded per issue (1/1, 2/2, or 3/3). The main risk areas identified were subtitle accessibility (readability and occlusion), early-game clarity and confirmation gaps when audio cues were removed, and seated interaction and UI clarity issues in Room 3. Comfort checks for movement, turning, and stability were also exercised across multiple sessions, with findings recorded against the relevant charters.</p>

<h2 id="applied-insight">🤝 Networking &amp; Applied Insight</h2>

<p class="method-note">
  For this project, I did not rely on personal preference or gut feel. I built the charters and checks on top of
  established XR accessibility guidance, plus targeted input from people actively working in VR and XR accessibility.
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  <strong>Ian Hamilton</strong> (VR accessibility guidance) formed the comfort foundation of the project. I used his comfort
  fundamentals to shape the “spine” charters for camera behaviour, locomotion, vignettes, horizon stability, seated play, and
  VR text readability. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  <strong>Jamie Knight</strong> (BBC XR Barriers, cognitive accessibility) influenced the cognitive layer of the pass.
  Based on his direction, I used the BBC XR Barriers framework as a set of heuristics and built COG01 to COG05 around
  comprehension, expectation, wayfinding, timing, and focus and memory. This was treated as a heuristic accessibility review,
  not a user study. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  <strong>Dr Tracy Gardner</strong> (Flip Computing, Flock XR) reinforced that movement design is one of the highest risk areas
  for VR accessibility because poor locomotion can trigger nausea and put players off VR entirely. Her feedback helped frame
  locomotion and rotation checks as access barriers and retention risks, not just “comfort preferences”, and it pushed me to
  strengthen checks around text controls and multi-modal communication. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  I also used <strong>W3C XR Accessibility User Requirements (XAUR)</strong> as the standards layer to keep checks aligned with
  formal XR accessibility expectations. This supported charters around seated posture, alternative input paths, reduced motor
  strain, multi-sensory communication, and UI clarity. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  Finally, I used <strong>Game Accessibility Guidelines</strong> as the practical pattern layer. This strengthened expectations
  around text size and contrast, subtitle and audio cue patterns, and cognitive load reduction (chunking, re-readable
  instructions, and reducing multi-task overload). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  Together, these layers shaped how I wrote the charters, what I prioritised in sessions, and how I described player impact
  in the final write-up. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

<p class="method-note">
  This project was a charter-driven accessibility and comfort pass for seated VR play on <em>Shadow Point</em> (Meta Quest 3,
  standalone, build 1.4), tested from 8 to 13 December 2025. Across 20 logged sessions (S-001 to S-020), I focused on comfort
  stability (camera behaviour, locomotion, horizon reference points), subtitle accessibility, non-audio cue redundancy, seated
  reach and input strain, and cognitive barriers during early puzzle interaction.
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  Across the project I logged 11 issues in the Bug Log. The main themes were subtitle accessibility problems, including
  readability and occlusion (SP-12, SP-17, SP-24, SP-25), clarity and confirmation gaps when audio cues were removed or volume
  was set to 0 (SP-27, SP-28), and Room 3 seated interaction and UI clarity issues (SP-18 to SP-21). One additional low
  priority visual issue was logged for hand alignment during move plus look (SP-4).

<h2 id="results">📈 Results</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Completed a one-week, charter-driven accessibility and comfort pass for seated VR play on Meta Quest 3 standalone
    (build 1.4), across 20 logged sessions (S-001 to S-020).
  </li>

  <li>
    Logged <strong>11 issues in total</strong> in the Bug Log: <strong>7 medium</strong> and <strong>4 low</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Repro evidence was recorded per issue, with a mix of <strong>3/3</strong>, <strong>2/2</strong>, and <strong>1/1</strong> depending on how many rechecks were run.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Primary theme: subtitles (accessibility and readability).</strong> Multiple issues centred on subtitle legibility and occlusion,
    including UI overlays and held objects obscuring subtitles, and subtitle behaviour during the cable car sequence
    (SP-12, SP-17, SP-24, SP-25).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Audio removed: confirmation gaps.</strong> When volume was set to 0, tutorial steps relied on audio without sufficient
    visual or haptic confirmation, creating a non-audio cue redundancy risk (SP-27, SP-28).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Seated interaction and UI clarity.</strong> Room 3 testing surfaced seated reach and clarity issues, including interactables
    that present as grabbable but fail at normal seated reach and UI signalling that can mislead the player (SP-18 to SP-21).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Comfort and movement surfaces were exercised.</strong> Camera and locomotion comfort checks were run across sessions
    (including the cable car sequence), with outcomes captured against the relevant charters and any issues logged where found.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>🏁 Result and takeaway</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Result:</strong> Across a one-week, charter-driven accessibility and comfort pass on <em>Shadow Point</em> (Meta Quest 3, standalone, build 1.4),
  I completed 20 logged sessions and recorded 11 issues in the Bug Log (7 medium, 4 low), each with captured evidence and a recorded repro rate.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Takeaway:</strong> The highest-impact risks were concentrated in subtitle accessibility and clarity when audio cues were removed.
  Subtitle occlusion and behaviour issues can block comprehension for players who rely on subtitles, and non-audio confirmation gaps at volume 0
  create avoidable barriers for Deaf and hard of hearing players or anyone playing with reduced audio. Seated interaction and UI clarity issues in Room 3
  also show how small reach and signalling problems can turn into friction and frustration in puzzle progression.

<h2 id="what-i-learned">🧠 What I learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Charters stop VR testing from becoming chaos.</strong>
    A clear Charter Matrix kept the week focused and made it obvious what had been covered, what was consolidated, and what still needed a follow up.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Comfort is an accessibility baseline, not a preference.</strong>
    Treating locomotion, turning, horizon stability and predictable camera behaviour as access surfaces helped me prioritise checks that directly affect whether someone can keep playing.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Subtitles are a core UX surface in VR.</strong>
    Occlusion and readability issues were not minor. When subtitles are blocked by UI or held objects, comprehension can fail instantly for players who rely on them.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Audio-off testing exposes missing redundancy fast.</strong>
    Setting volume to 0 is a simple way to reveal where the game depends on audio without providing equivalent visual or haptic confirmation.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Seated reach needs to match what the UI promises.</strong>
    If an interactable highlights and shows a grab icon but cannot be grabbed at normal seated reach, the game is effectively misleading the player and creating unnecessary friction.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Cognitive checks belong in puzzle VR.</strong>
    Using the BBC XR Barriers as heuristics helped me frame confusion, missing expectation setting, and unclear wayfinding as accessibility issues rather than player error.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Good admin makes the work easy to audit.</strong>
    Session IDs, clear repro notes, and consistent evidence logging kept the project easy to review and reduced time wasted trying to reconstruct what happened.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">🔚 Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  One-week, charter-driven accessibility and comfort pass completed on <em>Shadow Point</em> (Meta Quest 3, standalone, build 1.4),
  tested from 8 to 13 December 2025. The project was tightly scoped to seated VR play and high-risk accessibility surfaces,
  using structured charters rather than broad, unbounded exploration.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Coverage delivered:</strong>
    comfort stability checks for camera behaviour and horizon reference points, locomotion and turning options, and the cable car sequence,
    plus seated reach and input strain checks, subtitle availability and readability, non-audio cue redundancy at volume 0,
    and early-room cognitive barrier checks (comprehension, expectation, and wayfinding).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Highest-impact findings:</strong>
    subtitle accessibility issues, including occlusion and behaviour problems (SP-12, SP-17, SP-24, SP-25),
    and confirmation gaps when audio was removed or reduced (SP-27, SP-28). These risks can block comprehension and increase friction,
    especially for players who rely on subtitles or non-audio cues.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Evidence maturity:</strong>
    Coverage and outcomes are traceable through the Charter Matrix and Session Log, with 11 logged issues recorded in the Bug Log.
    Each issue includes severity, repro rate, and the matching evidence type (video, screenshot, or both), providing a clear audit trail
    from session observations to final conclusions.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Up next:</strong> Educational UX and cognitive load testing on a browser-based 3D game design tool for young learners. This planned case study focuses on first-time onboarding and the “what do I do now?” moment, learning
  flow and pacing of concepts, feedback and error recovery, and lightweight accessibility checks for text, contrast, icons, and
  hit targets. Planned deliverables include a first-time learner journey map, a short set of UX and accessibility findings with
  practical recommendations, and an issue list grouped by onboarding, learning flow, and editor usability. The product name will
  remain anonymous by agreement, and findings will be shared privately unless I have approval to publish a named case study.
