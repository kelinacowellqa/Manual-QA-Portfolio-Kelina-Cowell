 <h1>🎮 Sworn – Regression Testing Case Study (PC Game Pass Edition, Team17) – Tested: 22/11/2025 – 03/12/2025</h1>

<!-- Intro -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  One-week, change-driven regression pass on <em>Sworn</em> (PC Game Pass, Windows, build 1.01.0.1039) focused on golden-path
  stability (launch → play → quit → relaunch), save/load integrity, core menus, audio sanity, input handover, and areas
  plausibly touched by the latest public Steam patch notes. This was a solo, portfolio-only project using SteamDB patch notes
  as an external oracle, without claiming parity with the Steam build.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Scope:</strong> change-driven, risk-based regression against the current PC Game Pass build, covering golden-path
    flow (launch → main menu → run → quit → relaunch), autosave <em>Continue</em> behaviour, settings navigation and
    persistence, death → Stats → hub flow, audio continuity and settings, Enhancements/Codex readability and persistence,
    power-up next-room behaviour, pause/Alt+Tab sanity, and controller ↔ mouse/keyboard handover with one hot plug.
    Onboarding accessibility issues first found on Day 0 (<strong>SWOR-1</strong> to <strong>SWOR-4</strong>) are still logged as
    full bugs, but in the Regression Matrix they are treated as a single known A11y cluster because there was no newer build
    to re-test.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Approach:</strong> one-week solo pass built around a Regression Matrix and time-boxed Session Log, with each check
    mapped to a specific patch-note item or baseline risk area. SteamDB patch notes for SWORN 1.0 Patch #3 (v1.0.3.1111,
    13 Nov 2025) were used as an upstream oracle, but only as guidance. Each session captured clear anchors, expected
    outcomes, and results (Pass, Fail, Not applicable, Known issue), with focused rechecks where needed (for example
    reconfirming the death-flow defect in <strong>SWOR-6</strong>).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong> Regression Matrix result: 8 passes, 1 fail, 1 not applicable, and 1 known A11y cluster. Across the
    whole project I tracked six defects in the bug log: four onboarding accessibility prompt issues
    (<strong>SWOR-1</strong>–<strong>SWOR-4</strong>), one post-death flow defect where the Defeat overlay blocks Stats and
    <em>Continue</em> starts a new run (<strong>SWOR-6</strong>), and one Blessing choice readability issue
    (<strong>SWOR-15</strong>). Together they describe the current A11y and flow risks on this build.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Evidence:</strong> Google Sheets workbook (README, 1-liner summary, Regression Matrix, Session Log, Bug Log,
    STAR Summary, Glossary) plus OBS/Xbox Game Bar recordings uploaded to YouTube, grouped by area (baseline flow,
    settings, save/load, death flow, audio, Enhancements, power-ups, Alt+Tab, input handover, economy). All checks and bugs
    are cross-linked from the Matrix and Session Log so reviewers can jump straight from the portfolio page into the exact
    clip or log entry.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="star-summary">⭐ STAR SUMMARY – Sworn Regression QA (PC Game Pass)</h2>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong> One-week, change-driven regression pass on <strong>Sworn</strong> (PC Game Pass, Windows, build 1.01.0.1039). The SteamDB patch notes for v1.0.3.1111 were used as an external oracle to guide what areas might reasonably need rechecking, without claiming parity between platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Validate that key systems on the PC Game Pass build behaved correctly after upstream changes – golden-path stability, save/load, settings persistence, audio, death-flow logic, Enhancements/Codex behaviour, power-ups, Alt+Tab, and input handover – and keep previously identified onboarding accessibility issues visible as a known risk cluster on this build.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Built a Regression Matrix mapped to patch-note items and baseline risks, then executed targeted sessions across the week. Each check was time-boxed with clear anchors and expected outcomes, and marked as Pass, Fail, Not applicable or Known issue. All evidence was captured using OBS/Xbox Game Bar and logged into a structured Google Sheets workbook with a Bug Log (six defects: SWOR-1–SWOR-4, SWOR-6, SWOR-15), STAR Summary and fully linked Session Log.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> The Regression Matrix outcome was <strong>8 passes, 1 fail, 1 not applicable and 1 known A11y cluster</strong>. Most areas passed as expected, including launch→play→quit→relaunch, autosave <em>Continue</em>, settings navigation/persistence, audio continuity, Enhancements/Codex behaviour, power-up behaviour, Alt+Tab, and controller↔KBM handover with one hot plug. One regression-relevant defect was confirmed: <strong>SWOR-6</strong> (Defeat overlay remains foregrounded, blocking Stats, and <em>Continue</em> starts a new run). A small visual-readability issue in the Blessing choice screen (<strong>SWOR-15</strong>) was also documented. Onboarding accessibility prompt issues (<strong>SWOR-1</strong> to <strong>SWOR-4</strong>) are tracked in the bug log as a single A11y cluster on this build, but were not re-run in new sessions because no newer build was available.</p>

<h2 id="applied-insight">🤝 Networking &amp; Applied Insight</h2>

<p class="method-note">
  During this project I did not guess the scope in isolation, I treated it like a mini live-ops assignment and shaped it around advice from senior QA leads.
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-glatus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <strong>Nathan Glatus</strong>
  </a>
  (ex Senior QA / Game Integrity Analyst, Fortnite, Epic Games) helped me set the initial scope. His advice
  was to treat Rebel Racing as what it is: a live mobile F2P racer, not a lab toy for every possible edge
  case. That translated into a small set of focused charters rather than a giant “test everything” list:
  daily golden-path smoke on a single physical device, input and handling tiers, collisions / exits and race
  flow, and UI scaling and key live surfaces (store, events, hub). He also pushed me to keep runs to realistic
  45–60 minute sessions with clear exit criteria, and to write tighter bug reports with strong oracles, clear
  summaries and bundled evidence (video, device/build metadata, repro steps, repro rate) instead of vague
  “it feels off” notes. His framing around realistic coverage on an approved device list is why this case
  study is scoped to one main phone but documented in a way that could scale to a real QA team.
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raduposoi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <strong>Radu Posoi</strong>
  </a>
  (Founder, AlkoTech Labs, ex Ubisoft QA Lead) then helped me iterate the scope so it matched how mobile QA
  is actually run day to day. His feedback led me to define clear performance anchors (hub, pre-race, race
  start, mid-race, results) instead of vague “seems fine” checks; treat interruptions as a first-class surface
  covering lock screen, app switching, app kill and recovery, and notification shade; and turn battery, heat and
  multi-touch stress into dedicated charters rather than random one-off experiments. Because Rebel Racing blocks
  standard Android Studio emulators on the Play Store, he also recommended using Bluestacks as a visual-only
  oracle for odd aspect ratios and layout stretch while keeping all real testing and bug reproduction on my
  physical Moto g54. That combination turned my original “nice to have” ideas into a concrete device and network
  approach that looks like a small slice of a real mobile QA lab rather than a student project.
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  Their insight directly shaped the final list of charters, including the extra lock/unlock interruption runs
  that revealed the audio issue on the Results/Rewards screen (RR-37). It also shaped how I recorded device and
  network context, how I wrote and prioritised bug reports, and the STAR summary for this case study, so the
  project reads more like a realistic live mobile QA engagement than a purely academic exercise.

<h2 id="core-findings">📌 Core Project Findings – Sessions and Bugs</h2>

<p class="method-note">
  All planned regression checks were completed on the PC Game Pass build with no crashes or instability across the golden
  path. Most systems behaved as expected, including launch→play→quit→relaunch, autosave <em>Continue</em>, settings
  persistence, audio, Enhancements/Codex, power-up behaviour, Alt+Tab, and controller↔KBM handover. Across the project I
  logged six issues in the bug log: four onboarding accessibility prompt problems (<strong>SWOR-1</strong>–<strong>SWOR-4</strong>),
  one medium-severity defect in the death-flow sequence (<strong>SWOR-6</strong>, where the Defeat overlay remains
  foregrounded and blocks full Stats access while <em>Continue</em> starts a new run), and one low-severity issue in the
  Blessing choice screen (<strong>SWOR-15</strong>) for small, low-contrast key prompts. The onboarding A11y bugs were
  originally found on Day 0 and are tracked here as a known cluster on this build; they were not re-run in new sessions
  because there was no newer build to verify against.

<h2 id="results">📈 Results</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Completed all planned regression checks on the PC Game Pass build with no crashes or instability
    across the golden path (launch → play → quit → relaunch).
  </li>

  <li>
    Logged <strong>six defects in total</strong>:
    four onboarding A11y prompt issues (<strong>SWOR-1</strong>–<strong>SWOR-4</strong>),
    one medium-severity death-flow defect (<strong>SWOR-6</strong>),
    and one medium-severity Blessing choice readability issue (<strong>SWOR-15</strong>).
    All six reproduced consistently (3/3) and are documented with screenshots or video.
  </li>

  <li>
    Confirmed core systems behaved as expected: autosave <em>Continue</em>, settings navigation and
    persistence, audio continuity, Enhancements and Codex behaviour, power-up effects, pause menu,
    Alt+Tab, and controller↔KBM handover with one hot plug.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Death-flow defect (SWOR-6):</strong> the Defeat overlay remains foregrounded after death, blocking
    the Stats panel. Pressing <em>Continue</em> immediately starts a new run. Reproduced reliably
    and captured on video.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Blessing prompt readability (SWOR-15):</strong> Blessing choice key prompts appear extremely small
    with low contrast. Logged as a medium-severity A11y/UI issue due to readability impact.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Onboarding A11y prompt cluster (SWOR-1 → SWOR-4):</strong>
    small, low-cue, and easy-to-miss tutorial prompts were still present. These were originally
    identified on Day 0 and are treated as a known cluster on this build because no newer build
    was available for re-testing.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Dialogue Volume setting:</strong> this setting appears in upstream patch notes but is <em>not present</em>
    on the PC Game Pass build. Marked as “Not applicable” rather than a defect.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>General stability:</strong> no stutters, hitches or progression blockers occurred during any run.
    All sessions cleanly returned to main menu and relaunched without issue.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><h3>🏁 Result and takeaway</h3></p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> The PC Game Pass build of <em>Sworn</em> remained stable across all golden-path and targeted regression checks. Six defects were logged in total: four onboarding accessibility prompt issues (SWOR-1–SWOR-4), one medium-severity death-flow defect (SWOR-6), and one medium-severity Blessing choice readability issue (SWOR-15). All reproduced consistently and are fully documented with evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Sworn’s core systems are generally robust, but UI readability and onboarding prompt visibility need attention, especially for accessibility. The death-flow defect (SWOR-6) is the highest-impact issue and should be prioritised, while the A11y cluster highlights the need for clearer tutorial cueing in early game moments.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">🧠 What I learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Controlled scope is the only way regression stays meaningful.</strong>
    Mapping each check to a patch-note item or a clear risk area prevented the week from turning into an unfocused
    re-test of the whole game and kept every session intentional.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Short, purposeful evidence beats long recordings.</strong>
    Tight clips of the golden path, menu flows and the death-flow defect (SWOR-6) made review fast and kept the workbook
    clean. Anything longer would have buried the signal.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The Regression Matrix should do the heavy lifting.</strong>
    Being explicit about expected vs actual outcomes made the STAR summary almost automatic and turned the project into a
    coherent story instead of a pile of notes.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Readability issues aren’t cosmetic.</strong>
    The Blessing choice prompts (SWOR-15) highlighted how small, low-contrast UI genuinely slows decision-making and can
    exclude players who rely on clear visual cues.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Audio continuity matters to perceived polish.</strong>
    Missing or inconsistent settings — like the Dialogue Volume slider referenced upstream but absent here — still affect
    player trust even if the game “works”.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Good notes pay you back immediately.</strong>
    Clear Session Log entries meant I could pick up the project the next day without relearning anything, which kept the
    week efficient and consistent.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Dyslexia surfaces UX problems early.</strong>
    Dense text and cramped layouts in Enhancements and the Codex stood out instantly, which helped justify why these
    readability issues matter from an accessibility perspective.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Admin should help, not hinder.</strong>
    Keeping IDs simple, avoiding duplication and letting the workbook be the single source of truth made the project easy
    to maintain and easy to audit.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">🔚 Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  One-week, change-driven regression pass completed on <em>Sworn</em> (PC Game Pass). The project remained tightly scoped to
  patch-note-driven checks and baseline stability on the current build. All regression sessions were completed without
  crashes, and the core golden path remained stable throughout the week.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Coverage delivered:</strong>
    launch → play → quit → relaunch golden path, autosave <em>Continue</em> behaviour, settings navigation and persistence,
    audio continuity, Enhancements and Codex readability, power-up behaviour, death-flow logic, pause and Alt+Tab checks,
    and controller ↔ keyboard/mouse handover including one hot plug. Four onboarding accessibility prompt issues
    (<strong>SWOR-1</strong>–<strong>SWOR-4</strong>) were tracked as a known A11y cluster on this build because no updates
    were available to verify fixes.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Highest-impact findings:</strong>
    <em>SWOR-6</em> — Defeat overlay remains foregrounded after death, blocking the Stats breakdown and causing
    <em>Continue</em> to start a new run.  
    <em>SWOR-15</em> — Blessing choice key prompts are very small and low-contrast, creating an accessibility risk.
    Together with the onboarding A11y cluster, these findings highlight that readability and prompt visibility are the
    main UX concerns on this build.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Evidence maturity:</strong>
    Every check is backed by a Regression Matrix entry, Session Log, short focused video or screenshot evidence, and clear
    Jira-style bug and STAR summaries. The workbook forms a single, fully traceable source of truth for the entire
    regression week, showing how each conclusion was reached.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Up next:</strong> I am moving on to my dedicated VR Comfort & Accessibility case study on
  <em>Shadow Point</em> (Quest 3). This project focuses on micro-judder and comfort checks, tracking stability,
  guardian/boundary behaviour, text and UI readability in VR, and how comfortable it feels to play on a standalone
  Quest 3 over longer sessions. I’ll be using a simple comfort/test matrix and Quest capture to document comfort
  ratings, accessibility risks, and any interaction or readability issues that only show up in-headset.
