 <h1>🎮 Sworn - Regression Testing Case Study (PC Game Pass Edition) - Tested: 22/11/2025 - 03/12/2025</h1>

<!-- Intro -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  One-week, change-driven regression pass on <em>Sworn</em> (PC Game Pass, Windows, build 1.01.0.1039) focused on golden-path
  stability (launch → play → quit → relaunch), save/load integrity, core menus, audio sanity, input handover, and areas
  plausibly touched by the latest public Steam patch notes. This was a solo, portfolio-only project using SteamDB patch notes
  as an external oracle, without claiming parity with the Steam build.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Scope:</strong> Change-driven, risk-based regression on the current PC Game Pass build. Coverage focused on
    golden-path stability (launch → play → quit → relaunch), save/load integrity, core menus, audio continuity, input
    handover, and any areas plausibly touched by the latest public patch notes. SteamDB notes were treated purely as an
    external oracle for context, not as a source of parity requirements.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Approach:</strong> One-week solo pass executed through a Regression Matrix and a time-boxed Session Log.
    Each check was mapped to either a patch-note reference or a baseline risk area. Sessions documented clear anchors and
    expected outcomes, with targeted rechecks only where additional clarification was needed. Accessibility findings from
    Day 0 (SWOR-1 to SWOR-4) were consolidated into a single A11y cluster in the Matrix because no newer build existed to
    re-test them.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong> The Regression Matrix produced a balanced view of this build’s stability: 8 passes, 1 fail,
    1 not applicable, and 1 known A11y cluster. Six total defects were logged: four onboarding accessibility-prompt issues
    (SWOR-1 to SWOR-4), one post-death flow defect where the Defeat overlay blocks Stats and <em>Continue</em> begins a new
    run (SWOR-6), and one low-contrast Blessing choice prompt (SWOR-15). Together they outline the key flow and A11y risks
    on the current build.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Evidence:</strong> Google Sheets workbook (README, 1-liner summary, Regression Matrix, Session Log, Bug Log,
    STAR Summary, Glossary) plus OBS/Xbox Game Bar recordings uploaded privately to YouTube. Evidence is grouped by area
    (baseline flow, settings, save/load, death flow, audio, Enhancements, power-ups, Alt+Tab, input handover, economy),
    with the Matrix and Session Log cross-linked so reviewers can jump directly to the exact clip or log entry.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="star-summary">⭐ STAR SUMMARY – Sworn Regression QA (PC Game Pass)</h2>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong> One-week, change-driven regression pass on <strong>Sworn</strong> (PC Game Pass, Windows, build 1.01.0.1039). The SteamDB patch notes for v1.0.3.1111 were used as an external oracle to guide what areas might reasonably need rechecking, without claiming parity between platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Validate that key systems on the PC Game Pass build behaved correctly after upstream changes - golden-path stability, save/load, settings persistence, audio, death-flow logic, Enhancements/Codex behaviour, power-ups, Alt+Tab, and input handover – and keep previously identified onboarding accessibility issues visible as a known risk cluster on this build.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Built a Regression Matrix mapped to patch-note items and baseline risks, then executed targeted sessions across the week. Each check was time-boxed with clear anchors and expected outcomes, and marked as Pass, Fail, Not applicable or Known issue. All evidence was captured using OBS/Xbox Game Bar and logged into a structured Google Sheets workbook with a Bug Log (six defects: SWOR-1–SWOR-4, SWOR-6, SWOR-15), STAR Summary and fully linked Session Log.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> The Regression Matrix outcome was <strong>8 passes, 1 fail, 1 not applicable and 1 known A11y cluster</strong>. Most areas passed as expected, including launch→play→quit→relaunch, autosave <em>Continue</em>, settings navigation/persistence, audio continuity, Enhancements/Codex behaviour, power-up behaviour, Alt+Tab, and controller↔KBM handover with one hot plug. One regression-relevant defect was confirmed: <strong>SWOR-6</strong> (Defeat overlay remains foregrounded, blocking Stats, and <em>Continue</em> starts a new run). A small visual-readability issue in the Blessing choice screen (<strong>SWOR-15</strong>) was also documented. Onboarding accessibility prompt issues (<strong>SWOR-1</strong> to <strong>SWOR-4</strong>) are tracked in the bug log as a single A11y cluster on this build, but were not re-run in new sessions because no newer build was available.</p>

<h2 id="applied-insight">🤝 Networking & Applied Insight</h2>

<p class="method-note">
  During this project I didn’t guess the scope in isolation. I shaped the regression plan around targeted guidance
  from senior QA professionals, treating this as a miniature live-ops assignment instead of a theoretical exercise.
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  A QA Manager at a major game studio emphasised four principles for realistic regression work:
</p>

<ol class="method-note">
  <li>
    <strong>Map regression to where the game actually changed</strong> using multiple oracles such as patch notes,
    changelogs, community reports and, where useful, historical behaviour from earlier builds or fandom wikis.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Prioritise must-not-break systems</strong> such as save/load, session flow, input ownership and menu stability.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Match the test approach to the surface:</strong>
    scripted test cases for critical flows, exploratory charters for large or complex spaces, and lightweight matrices
    for broad variable sets that don't need deep test-case detail.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Keep the suite maintainable</strong> so each check traces directly back to either a patch-note change or a
    genuine risk area instead of becoming a full re-test of the entire game.
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="method-note">
  I applied this by redesigning my Regression Matrix so that every entry ties to a specific change, a stability
  requirement or a coverage slice. For Sworn, historical-oracle references were not required because the SteamDB patch
  notes already provided sufficient clarity on what had changed.
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  <strong>Steph McStea</strong> (QA Lead at Double Eleven) reinforced the importance of focusing on the golden path and 
  known “repeat offender” areas when time is limited. Instead of touching every system in Sworn, I centred the 
  regression on what most players hit every session and gave extra attention to clusters already known to be fragile 
  from earlier testing. This kept the plan achievable for a one-week solo regression while still mirroring how real 
  studios prioritise player-impacting surfaces.
</p>

<p class="method-note">
  Their combined insight directly shaped how I scoped the project, the way I structured my Regression Matrix, how I 
  prioritised checks like death-flow logic and UI readability, and how I presented evidence. It ensured the final case
  study reads like a focused, change-driven regression effort rather than a wide, undefined testing sweep.

        Regression should be <strong>change-driven, risk-based and traceable</strong>.  
        Use multiple oracles appropriately: patch notes, changelogs, known issues, and—when relevant—historical
        behaviour from earlier builds or fandom wikis, while understanding their fallibility.  
        Choose the right test method for the surface: test cases for non-negotiable flows, exploratory charters for
        complex behaviour, and matrices for broad variable spaces.

<h2 id="core-findings">📌 Core Project Findings - Sessions and Bugs</h2>

<p class="method-note">
  All planned regression checks were completed on the PC Game Pass build with no crashes or instability across the golden
  path. Most systems behaved as expected, including launch→play→quit→relaunch, autosave <em>Continue</em>, settings
  persistence, audio, Enhancements/Codex, power-up behaviour, Alt+Tab, and controller↔KBM handover. Across the project I
  logged six issues in the bug log: four onboarding accessibility prompt problems (<strong>SWOR-1</strong>–<strong>SWOR-4</strong>),
  one medium-severity defect in the death-flow sequence (<strong>SWOR-6</strong>, where the Defeat overlay remains
  foregrounded and blocks full Stats access while <em>Continue</em> starts a new run), and one low-severity issue in the
  Blessing choice screen (<strong>SWOR-15</strong>) for small, low-contrast key prompts. The onboarding A11y bugs were
  originally found on Day 0 and are tracked here as a known cluster on this build; they were not re-run in new sessions
  because there was no newer build to verify against.

<h2 id="results">📈 Results</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Completed all planned regression checks on the PC Game Pass build with no crashes or instability
    across the golden path (launch → play → quit → relaunch).
  </li>

  <li>
    Logged <strong>six defects in total</strong>:
    four onboarding A11y prompt issues (<strong>SWOR-1</strong>–<strong>SWOR-4</strong>),
    one medium-severity death-flow defect (<strong>SWOR-6</strong>),
    and one medium-severity Blessing choice readability issue (<strong>SWOR-15</strong>).
    All six reproduced consistently (3/3) and are documented with screenshots or video.
  </li>

  <li>
    Confirmed core systems behaved as expected: autosave <em>Continue</em>, settings navigation and
    persistence, audio continuity, Enhancements and Codex behaviour, power-up effects, pause menu,
    Alt+Tab, and controller↔KBM handover with one hot plug.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Death-flow defect (SWOR-6):</strong> the Defeat overlay remains foregrounded after death, blocking
    the Stats panel. Pressing <em>Continue</em> immediately starts a new run. Reproduced reliably
    and captured on video.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Blessing prompt readability (SWOR-15):</strong> Blessing choice key prompts appear extremely small
    with low contrast. Logged as a medium-severity A11y/UI issue due to readability impact.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Onboarding A11y prompt cluster (SWOR-1 → SWOR-4):</strong>
    small, low-cue, and easy-to-miss tutorial prompts were still present. These were originally
    identified on Day 0 and are treated as a known cluster on this build because no newer build
    was available for re-testing.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Dialogue Volume setting:</strong> this setting appears in upstream patch notes but is <em>not present</em>
    on the PC Game Pass build. Marked as “Not applicable” rather than a defect.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>General stability:</strong> no stutters, hitches or progression blockers occurred during any run.
    All sessions cleanly returned to main menu and relaunched without issue.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><h3>🏁 Result and takeaway</h3></p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> The PC Game Pass build of <em>Sworn</em> remained stable across all golden-path and targeted regression checks. Six defects were logged in total: four onboarding accessibility prompt issues (SWOR-1–SWOR-4), one medium-severity death-flow defect (SWOR-6), and one medium-severity Blessing choice readability issue (SWOR-15). All reproduced consistently and are fully documented with evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Sworn’s core systems are generally robust, but UI readability and onboarding prompt visibility need attention, especially for accessibility. The death-flow defect (SWOR-6) is the highest-impact issue and should be prioritised, while the A11y cluster highlights the need for clearer tutorial cueing in early game moments.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">🧠 What I learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Controlled scope keeps regression useful.</strong>
    Mapping checks to patch-note items or clear risk areas stopped this from becoming a blurry re-test of the whole game.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>The Regression Matrix should do the heavy lifting.</strong>
    Being explicit about expected vs actual outcomes turned the STAR summary into simple reporting instead of reconstruction.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Patches don’t live in isolation.</strong>
    Feedback from a senior QA manager reinforced that regression shouldn’t stop at confirming patch-note items. In this project I focused on patch-note coverage and baseline risks; in future passes I’ll expand the matrix with planned adjacency sweeps to look for side effects in neighbouring systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Short, purposeful evidence beats long recordings.</strong>
    Tight clips of the golden path, key menus and the death-flow defect (SWOR-6) made review quick and kept the workbook readable.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Readability issues aren’t cosmetic.</strong>
    The Blessing choice prompts (SWOR-15) showed how low-contrast, cramped UI slows decision-making and can exclude players who need clear visual cues.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Dyslexia surfaces UX problems early.</strong>
    Dense text and cramped layouts in Enhancements and the Codex stood out immediately, which helped frame these issues as accessibility risks, not just “polish”.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Admin should help, not hinder.</strong>
    Simple IDs and a single source of truth in the workbook made the project easy to pick up, maintain and audit.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">🔚 Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  One-week, change-driven regression pass completed on <em>Sworn</em> (PC Game Pass). The project remained tightly scoped to
  patch-note-driven checks and baseline stability on the current build. All regression sessions were completed without
  crashes, and the core golden path remained stable throughout the week.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Coverage delivered:</strong>
    launch → play → quit → relaunch golden path, autosave <em>Continue</em> behaviour, settings navigation and persistence,
    audio continuity, Enhancements and Codex readability, power-up behaviour, death-flow logic, pause and Alt+Tab checks,
    and controller ↔ keyboard/mouse handover including one hot plug. Four onboarding accessibility prompt issues
    (<strong>SWOR-1</strong>–<strong>SWOR-4</strong>) were tracked as a known A11y cluster on this build because no updates
    were available to verify fixes.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Highest-impact findings:</strong>
    <em>SWOR-6</em> - Defeat overlay remains foregrounded after death, blocking the Stats breakdown and causing
    <em>Continue</em> to start a new run.  
    <em>SWOR-15</em> - Blessing choice key prompts are very small and low-contrast, creating an accessibility risk.
    Together with the onboarding A11y cluster, these findings highlight that readability and prompt visibility are the
    main UX concerns on this build.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Evidence maturity:</strong>
    Every check is backed by a Regression Matrix entry, Session Log, short focused video or screenshot evidence, and clear
    Jira-style bug and STAR summaries. The workbook forms a single, fully traceable source of truth for the entire
    regression week, showing how each conclusion was reached.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Up next:</strong> I am moving on to my dedicated VR Comfort & Accessibility case study on
  <em>Shadow Point</em> (Quest 3). This project focuses on micro-judder and comfort checks, tracking stability,
  guardian/boundary behaviour, text and UI readability in VR, and how comfortable it feels to play on a standalone
  Quest 3 over longer sessions. I’ll be using a simple comfort/test matrix and Quest capture to document comfort
  ratings, accessibility risks, and any interaction or readability issues that only show up in-headset.
