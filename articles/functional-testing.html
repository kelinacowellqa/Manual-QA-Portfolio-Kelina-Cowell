        This article is based on a one-week solo functional pass on <strong>Battletoads (PC, Game Pass)</strong>.
        If the testing sounds basic, that is intentional. In this project, the highest-impact defects lived in the fundamentals.

    <h2 id="what-it-is">What functional testing was in this project</h2>
    <p>
      In this Battletoads pass, functional testing meant validating whether the game behaved as expected
      end-to-end under realistic player conditions, using both controller and keyboard on PC.
      Core flows were validated first, followed by focused checks where risk appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scope was deliberately constrained to expose defects early:
      <strong>Battletoads (PC, Game Pass), Build 1.1F.42718</strong>,
      tested on Windows 11 at 1920×1080 @144Hz with VRR and V-Sync enabled.
    </p>

    <section class="callout">
      <h3>The main output</h3>
      <p>
        Clear pass or fail outcomes, backed by short evidence clips and reproducible steps.
        No interpretation, no assumptions, no opinion-based reporting.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2 id="two-flows">The two flows I tested first</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Start → first control</strong><br>
        From Title into Level 1 (L1-A1), the player must reliably gain control and progress
        through the first arena. In Battletoads, early progression includes an arena exit
        with no explicit UI cue, making this a high-risk flow to validate first.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pause / Resume</strong><br>
        Pause interacts with input routing, UI focus, audio muting, HUD state, and co-op joins.
        In this project, Pause testing surfaced the majority of functional defects.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="input">Why input ownership became its own mini-suite</h2>
    <p>
      Battletoads on PC supports both controller and keyboard.
      That makes mixed input the default state, not an edge case.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pause must respond consistently to the active input method.</li>
      <li>Navigation focus must not silently switch or become trapped.</li>
      <li>Confirm and back actions must not misroute to unrelated UI.</li>
      <li>Disconnecting or reconnecting input devices must not break control.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During this pass, keyboard ↔ controller hand-off produced
      multiple high-severity defects involving Pause and the Join In overlay,
      all reproducible within the first level.
    </p>

    <section class="callout">
      <h3>Observed pattern</h3>
      <p>
        Controller connected + keyboard input + Pause or Join In = focus and routing failures.
        These issues were consistent, repeatable, and isolated without late-game complexity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2 id="evidence">Evidence: what I captured and why</h2>
    <p>
      Short video clips (10–30 seconds) were the primary evidence format.
      These issues depended on timing, input, and focus state, which screenshots could not capture reliably.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Video:</strong> shows input, timing, and incorrect outcome together.</li>
      <li><strong>Screenshot:</strong> supports static UI state or control bindings.</li>
      <li><strong>Environment:</strong> build, platform, input devices, and display configuration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      If the evidence could not immediately show what was pressed, what happened,
      and what should have happened, it was replaced.
    </p>

    <h2 id="timebox">How this functional pass was timeboxed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Early runs:</strong> Smoke testing and baseline validation (start flow, Pause open/close).</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-pass:</strong> Expanded testing around Pause, input ownership, HUD, and audio.</li>
      <li><strong>Late runs:</strong> Repetition, confirmation, and isolation of mixed-input defects.</li>
      <li><strong>Final day:</strong> Outcome summary and documentation.</li>
    </ul>
