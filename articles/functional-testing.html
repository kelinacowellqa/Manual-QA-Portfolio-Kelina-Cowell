        This is the exact style of functional testing I run in a timeboxed solo pass.
        If it sounds basic, that’s because it is. Basic is where the breakage lives.

    <h2 id="what-it-is">What functional testing is (in practice)</h2>
    <p>
      For me, functional testing is simple: does the product do what it claims to do,
      end-to-end, without excuses or interpretation?
      I validate core flows, confirm expected behaviour, and write issues so a developer
      can reproduce them without guessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistake is treating functional testing as “easy” and therefore less valuable.
      It is the foundation. If the foundation is cracked, everything built on top of it
      fails in more complicated ways.
    </p>

    <section class="callout">
      <h3>Project context (for reference)</h3>
      <p class="small">
        This article is backed by a one-week solo functional pass on <strong>Battletoads (PC, Game Pass)</strong>
        using Windows 11 and mixed input (controller plus keyboard).
        Build tested: <code>1.1F.42718</code>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="callout">
      <h3>The main output</h3>
      <p>
        Clear outcomes: pass or fail, with evidence and reproducible steps.
        Not vibes. Not opinions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2 id="two-flows">The two flows I test first</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Start → first control</strong><br>
        The first minute determines whether the product feels broken.
        If “New Game” does not reliably get you playing, nothing else matters.
        <span class="small">In Battletoads, I validated this from Title into Level 1 (L1-A1) and through the first arena transition before expanding scope.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pause / Resume</strong><br>
        Pause stresses state, focus, input context, UI navigation and overlays.
        If Pause is unstable, you get a stream of bugs that look random but are not.
        <span class="small">In Battletoads (PC), Pause testing surfaced high-impact failures early in Level 1, including keyboard parity and input routing issues when a controller was connected.</span>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="input">Why input ownership deserves its own mini-suite</h2>
    <p>
      Mixed input is a feature, not an edge case.
      When a controller is connected and a keyboard is used, behaviour must remain predictable.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pause must open consistently.</li>
      <li>Navigation must respect the active input method.</li>
      <li>Confirm and back must not silently stop responding.</li>
      <li>Hand-off must not route to the wrong UI or disable input.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I treat keyboard ↔ controller hand-off as a dedicated test area because it produces
      high-impact, easily reproducible defects.
      <span class="small">In Battletoads (PC), keyboard actions from Pause could route into Join In, and in one case this left the controller unresponsive until the overlay was closed.</span>
    </p>

    <section class="callout">
      <h3>Common pattern</h3>
      <p>
        Controller connected + keyboard input + menu open = focus bugs.
        Easy to reproduce. Easy to prove. Easy to fix once isolated.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2 id="evidence">Evidence: what I capture and why</h2>
    <p>
      I favour short video clips (10–30 seconds) and only use screenshots when they add clarity.
      The goal is to make the defect obvious without forcing someone to scrub a long recording.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Video:</strong> shows timing, input, and incorrect outcome together.</li>
      <li><strong>Screenshot:</strong> supports UI state, text, or configuration.</li>
      <li><strong>Environment:</strong> platform, build/version, input device, display mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      If the evidence cannot answer what was pressed, what happened, and what should have happened,
      it is not evidence.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      In this Battletoads pass, short clips were essential because input and focus state changed quickly,
      and screenshots could not prove routing issues or temporary loss of control.
    </p>

    <h2 id="timebox">How I timebox a functional pass</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Smoke testing and baseline flow validation.</li>
      <li><strong>Days 2–4:</strong> Execute runs, expand where risk appears, log defects immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>Days 5–6:</strong> Retest, tighten repro steps, confirm consistency.</li>
      <li><strong>Day 7:</strong> Summarise outcomes and document learnings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      Practical note: I start each session with a short baseline loop (load, gain control, Pause, resume, exit)
      before running deeper checks. It catches obvious breakage early and prevents wasted time.
    </p>

    <h2 id="wrap">What this looked like in a real project</h2>
    <p>
      In the Battletoads functional pass (27 Oct to 1 Nov 2025), the most impactful defects were found in foundational flows
      within the first level. They did not require late-game content or unusual edge conditions to surface.
      That is why I front-load functional testing and treat input ownership as a first-class area on PC.
