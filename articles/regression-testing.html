      This article explains how I approach regression and edge-case testing in a real mobile QA pass,
      backed by a self-directed project on <strong>Rebel Racing</strong>.
      It focuses on workflow, risk selection, and evidence capture rather than theory.

  <h2 id="what-it-is">What regression testing is (in practice)</h2>
  <p>
    In practice, regression testing is about confirming that previously working behaviour
    still works after change, interruption, or repeated use.
    It is less about finding new features and more about catching breakage introduced by
    updates, state changes, or repeated flows.
  </p>
  <p>
    On mobile projects, regression is tightly coupled with edge-case testing because
    real users constantly interrupt the app, switch networks, lock devices, and resume sessions.
  </p>

  <h2 id="why-it-mattered">Why regression mattered in Rebel Racing</h2>
  <p>
    Rebel Racing is a live mobile title with frequent interaction loops:
    races, rewards, menus, ads, and progression screens.
    This makes it especially vulnerable to regression around state recovery and UI flow.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interruptions during rewards or transitions</li>
    <li>Repeated entry and exit from races</li>
    <li>UI scaling across devices and emulation</li>
    <li>Network variation between Wi-Fi and mobile data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="workflow">How I structured regression testing</h2>
  <p>
    Each testing session began with a short regression loop:
    launch, reach the hub, enter a race, complete it, claim rewards, and return to the hub.
    This baseline confirmed that the core loop still functioned before expanding into edge cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the baseline passed, I layered exploratory regression checks on top,
    focusing on areas that historically fail under interruption or repetition.
  </p>

  <h2 id="edge-cases">Targeting edge cases on mobile</h2>
  <p>
    Mobile regression testing cannot assume a stable environment.
    I deliberately introduced common real-world disruptions during otherwise normal flows.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Locking and unlocking the device mid-flow</li>
    <li>Pulling the notification shade during transitions</li>
    <li>Switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data</li>
    <li>Backgrounding and resuming the app</li>
    <li>Checking UI scaling via device variation and emulation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="findings">What I found</h2>
  <p>
    This approach surfaced both high-impact defects and lower-severity regressions.
    One example was a rewards-screen soft lock that occurred after repeated race completions,
    blocking progression entirely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other findings included audio timing issues and UI inconsistencies under specific
    interruption conditions.
    These were not visible during single clean runs but became reproducible through repetition.
  </p>

  <h2 id="evidence">Evidence and verification</h2>
  <p>
    Evidence was captured as short video clips showing the action taken,
    the interruption introduced, and the resulting behaviour.
    This made regression failures clear without requiring long recordings.
  </p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>Short mobile recordings (device and scrcpy)</li>
    <li>Structured Google Sheets workbook</li>
    <li>Logged defects with clear repro steps</li>
    <li>Re-verification after repeated attempts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="takeaways">Key takeaways</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>Regression testing is most effective when anchored to a stable baseline loop.</li>
    <li>On mobile, edge cases are not optional; they are part of regression.</li>
    <li>Repeated actions reveal failures that clean single runs hide.</li>
    <li>Short, targeted evidence clips speed up triage and verification.</li>
    <li>Regression thinking is about protecting progress, not just finding new bugs.</li>
  </ul>
